 <strong>For Prospective Graduate Students:</strong>
 <br/>

 I am actively recruiting Ph.D. and M.Sc. students who are interested in the area of Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, Urban Computing and related topics.  Research experience is not mandatory, interest and enthusiasm for computer networks is most important. I work closely with students in my group, and work together on interesting projects.  Every student will receive monthly RA allowance (though not high). </p>
 <p>If you have interest, please send me an email with your resume. I try to reply to all messages that are not spam.  Finally, in order to be admitted, you need to pass the entrance exam and interview.   </p>

 <strong>For Prospective Undergraduate Students:</strong>
 <br/>

 I&#8217;m also looking for CS undergraduates. Research positions are available for students with strong motivation of doing research in 
 <strong>computer networking</strong>
  and 
 <strong>machine learning</strong>
 .
 <br/>
 <br/>

 Your academic background is not the key concern, but your integrity and persistency toward research is of the most importance. 
 <br/>

 Generally speaking, I&#8217;m very happy to help undergraduate students to  accumulate research experience and become competitive in graduate admission. </p>
 <p>
     If you&#8217;re interested in working in my lab, please feel free to send me an email.   As a tradition, undergraduate students in my lab are encouraged to apply for 
     <a href="http://www.fdurop.fudan.edu.cn"> Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). </a>
